## Getting started

- [How to set up the plugin development environment](https://github.com/oidc-wp/openid-connect-generic/wiki/How-to-setup-the-plugin-development-environment)

## Coding Guidelines and Development ðŸ› 

- Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)
- Run our build process described in the document on [How to setup the plugin development environment](https://github.com/oidc-wp/openid-connect-generic/wiki/How-to-setup-the-plugin-development-environment), it will install everything needed to do development on our plugin.
- Whenever possible please fix pre-existing code standards errors in the files that you change. It is ok to skip that for larger files or complex fixes.
- Ensure you use LF line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Ensure that your code supports the minimum supported versions of PHP and WordPress; this is shown at the top of the `readme.txt` file.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the `develop` branch of the plugin repository.
- Make sure to write good and detailed commit messages (see [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more on this) and follow all the applicable sections of the pull request template.
- Please avoid modifying the changelog directly or updating the .pot files. These will be updated by the plugin team.

## Feature Requests ðŸš€

Feature requests can be [submitted to our issue tracker](https://github.com/oidc-wp/openid-connect-generic/issues/new?template=5-Feature-request.md).
